# System-Analysis-Design

>Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project is a web-based platform that allows the user to schedule driving lessons, take practice exams for the driving test, and also keep up to date with the current DMV laws and rules of the road. The client was looking to bridge a gap in the drivers educational field with an easier way to provide lessons, information, and practice exams to their users. This seemed like they wanted a friendly system that allowed the instructors to see their schedules, the students to schedule and update their reservations, and also the admins to be able to view the systems as well.

>What did you do particularly well?

I believe that my non-technical descriptions of these systems was best. In my current position, I do have be able to articlate to stakeholders the technical aspects of my job without all of the jargon. Also, having no one in my immediate family who is tech-savvy, I'm also used to scaling back the tech jargon and explaining concepts without confusing the audience. I also believe that I was able to articulate myself in the descriptions of the different requirements for this project.

>If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I had to choose one part of my work to revise, it would probably be the different diagrams. I would like to dive deeper into the layout and specifics of these diagrams to ensure that they are cohesive and purposeful. Right now I think they do a fine job of the task, but I would like to present this in a different fashion next time.

>How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to consider the user's needs in a design because they will be the one who will be using it. Having accessibility and the approach that makes it easy for the user to use is important because the easier it is for the user, the better the experience and the better chance you have of people using your product. I implemented their needs in the system by allowing them to reset passwords, have different ways to schedule, modify, and cancel their appointment, and we also allow them to pay from the site! 

>How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I think the design from the interview and thinking of how I would like to experience this as a user played a big part in the creation of these systems. Answering the question of how we would want to use a product can also go a long way. I feel that gathering data or seeing something that does a similar job and how can we make it better is a great way to approach a new system design.
